    "With the emergence of Machine Learning and AI, we are now able to utilize big data at a level that we could have never previously imagined. However, despite all these tools that are available at our disposal, it is still important on how we apply the data in a business context and how we make the most out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For retailers, more specifically book retailers, we can work with these big data using consumer reviewers from that was purchased, and then use those ratings to make recommendations for similar books that interests our consumers for recurring businesses and improved sales.\n",

    "**Business Solution:**\n",
    "- I will use an user-based Collaborative Filtering model to make predictions and recommend books to consumers\n",
